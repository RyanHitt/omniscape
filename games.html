        <td> Six Shots is a Twine-based text-adventure game with a focus on player
        choice and branching narrative paths. Your cowboy or cowgirl comes
        equipped with a revolver that can be fired on almost any screen in
        the game. It's up to you to decide whether to conserve your bullets
        and aid the denizens of Slate City or blast anything that crosses your
        path. Perhaps your vengeance will be realized... or perhaps you'll just
        end up in cowboy hell. </td>
