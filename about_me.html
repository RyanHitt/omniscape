        <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p> <span> <img src="https://img00.deviantart.net/16dd/i/2017/148/6/2/devid_2017_by_theryanaut-dbarkcm.png" width = 300px float = "right">
            </span> I have participated in engineering internships in the past
            and they have been constructive experiences that have lead me to a
            passion for designing and developing new applications. This
            internship is a great opportunity to prepare for an engineering
            career once I graduate. I thrive in environments where I am introduced
            to new challenges and enjoy learning independently as well as utilizing
            the knowledge of experienced professionals. Gore has a flexible
            workplace and a community I would integrate into and become a
            contributing part of. To me, the most important part of engineering
            is connecting and collaborating with others to achieve the best results
            as well as improving the skills of the individual.</p>

            <p> Told to make a webstie and hoping it wasn't graded on content, otherwise
              we are in big trouble. Because as I've stated before, while there are many
              words here, most of them have no meaning or value. <br>
