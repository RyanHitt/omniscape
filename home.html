    <p> So this is it. <br>
      You've come across my website which I've spent the better part of a week
      working on. Now it's not the prettiest thing ever, but it will get better. <br>
      ... <br>
      I promise...it will. As you can see, many of the elements of this website are not
      exactly what you asked for, I will explain. I'm passionate about board games and
      am currently in the process of developing one myself. <br>
      The website I currently have is a copy/paste WordPress website, by using this project
      to start desinging my website the way I want it, it has encouraged my to learn
      new things and actually have fun with the design. I hope this isn't an issue because
      I really do just want to apply what I'm learning in a way that is both fun and
      rewarding.  <br> <br>
